This is practice for connecting Oracle SQL and Eclipse classes.
I made Stored Procedure and i connected Java file.

 DBGuest_StoredProcedure
 it is for just notice about format of class contents.

 DBGuest_StoredProcedure2
 it made by for [insert, select, exit] data controlling.
 So if you press 1, then you can insert data.
 if you press 2, then you can select all of data which you inserted.
 if you press 3, then you can exit the program.

 DBGuest_StoredProcedure3
 Actually the class above was made during the class but i wanted to add more function in it.
 So i added [Update]. And different way of [select].
 If you press 4, then you can see as well as all of data, but for this time, 
 i used "CallableStatement" instead of jsut Statement. And also i used "Cursor" of SQL.
 And also the query called "guest_sp_select" which is Stored Procedure.
 I never used Stored Procedure before and this is my first connecting.

  DBTest2 
  It is just for connecting practice between SQL and Eclipse.

  DBTest_Manage
  This is made after connecting practice.
